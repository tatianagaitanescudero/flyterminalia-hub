# Papers

This folder curates publications and analyses related to *Drosophila* terminalia development, morphology, and gene regulation.  
Each subfolder will correspond to a specific paper or theme, and include reproducible scripts and metadata describing the figures.

## Folder Organization
- 2020s/ — recent publications with available datasets or figure-reproduction code
- methods/ — technical or methodological papers (e.g., imaging, computational pipelines)
- comparative/ — cross-species or evolutionary studies

Each paper entry may include:
- A citation and DOI link
- Notes on datasets used
- Scripts or notebooks reproducing specific figures
- Output plots and comparisons to the published work

## Goals
- Provide transparent, reproducible examples for the community
- Help researchers understand how analyses were performed
- Encourage reuse and extension of existing work

## Contribution
New papers and analyses can be added by creating a new subfolder and including a README.md that documents:
1. Paper title and citation
2. Data sources
3. Software dependencies
4. Commands or code to reproduce figures
