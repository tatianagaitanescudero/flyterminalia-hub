# Datasets

This directory contains scripts, metadata, and download instructions for public datasets relevant to *Drosophila* terminalia research.

## Dataset Categories
- **HCR-ISH/** — hybridization chain reaction and in situ hybridization images  
- **scRNAseq/** — single-cell RNA-seq datasets  
- **ATACseq/** — single-cell or bulk ATAC-seq datasets  
- **metadata/** — sample information, gene annotations, and data summaries

## Data Access
Each dataset subfolder should contain:
- A brief `README.md` explaining data origin and license  
- A script or notebook to download or preprocess the dataset  
- Optional example plots or summary statistics

## Notes
Large files should not be stored directly in the repository.
