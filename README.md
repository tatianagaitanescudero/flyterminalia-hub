# FlyTerminalia Hub

A curated hub of papers, datasets, and reproducible analyses for *Drosophila* terminalia research — foundation for future interactive imaging and single-cell exploration.

---

## Overview

FlyTerminalia Hub is an open, community-oriented repository designed to integrate and document resources related to *Drosophila* terminalia development and evolution.

This repository will serve as a central point to:

- Collect and curate datasets (HCR/ISH, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and imaging)
- Provide well-documented analysis code to reproduce published figures
- Share tutorials and workflows for single-cell and image analysis
- Develop and host interactive visualization tools (in the future)

The long-term goal is to build an integrated platform connecting imaging data, transcriptomic analyses, and reproducible research practices.

## Repository Structure

```
flyterminalia-hub/
│
├── papers/           # Paper metadata and figure reproduction notebooks
├── datasets/         # Scripts and links to public datasets
├── tutorials/        # Analysis and visualization walkthroughs
└── README.md         # Project overview

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tatianagaitanescudero/flyterminalia-hub.git
```

Then explore the folders in your preferred environment (RStudio, Jupyter, or VS Code).

To contribute or reproduce an analysis:
1. Navigate to the relevant paper or dataset folder  
2. Follow the accompanying README or tutorial  
3. Re-run the analysis or adapt it for new data

## Development and Future Modules

This repository will expand over time to include:

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| papers/ | Curated paper list with reproducible figures | In progress |
| datasets/ | Access scripts for public imaging and omics data | Planned |
| tutorials/ | Example analyses in R and Python | Planned |
| viewer/ | Interactive HCR/ISH image viewer (Web app) | Future |
| omics/ | Interactive scRNA/ATAC browser with upload support | Future |

Each module will indicate who implemented it, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and proper recognition for contributors.
